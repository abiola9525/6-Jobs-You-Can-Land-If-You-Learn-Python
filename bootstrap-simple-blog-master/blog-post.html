                            <h2 class="card-title">6 Jobs You Can Land If You Learn Python</h2>

                            <p class="card-text">Learning Python has gone mainstream. If you haven’t noticed, hundreds of today’s most successful tech companies are using Python, including Instagram, Netflix, Reddit, Lyft, Google, and Spotify. But it’s also being used at the New York Times, Bloomberg, and even at your local bank.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Python presents a number of clear paths to finding meaningful work. While some of those potential jobs may seem obvious — like becoming a Python developer —  other careers where knowing Python is an asset are more unexpected.</p>

                            <p>For example, did you know Python is used by some doctors? Mattan Griffel, Columbia University professor and author of the upcoming book Python for MBAs, explains his own surprise upon learning that his friend, a neuroscientist, uses Python:</p>
                            <center><q style="font-size: 13px;">That a neuroscientist would be spending up to one-fifth of his work time on Python underscored how programming and coding can no longer be viewed as an obscure tool used by computer nerds.</q></center>
                            
                            <p>Without a doubt, Python has become one of the best programming languages to learn if you want to upskill your career. Here are six careers that are perfect for job applicants with Python skills.</p>
                            <h2>1. Python Developer</h2>
                            <p>Becoming a Python developer is the most direct job out there for someone who knows the Python programming language.
                                <br><br>
                            A Python developer can be expected to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Build websites</li>
                                <li>Optimize data algorithms</li>
                                <li>Solve data analytics problems</li>
                                <li>Implementing security and data protection</li>
                                <li>Writing reusable, testable and efficient code</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A wide array of companies listed with Randstad are looking for Python developers. Learn Python today, and tomorrow you could end up as a Python developer working at a startup like Lyft, or larger company like ADP.</p><br>

                            <h2>2. Product Manager</h2>
                            <p>Product managers are responsible for researching new user features, find gaps in the market, and make an argument for why certain products should be built. Data plays a huge role in their work, so many companies are now seeking product managers who know Python.</p><br>

                            <h2>3. Data Analyst</h2>
                            <p>Does the idea of finding meaning in large amounts of information appeal to you? Many companies are looking for someone who can sift through large sets of data — and a popular way to accomplish that is using Python libraries such as SciPy and Pandas.<br><br>

Python is regarded as a top programming language when applied to machine learning, so it’s no surprise organizations like Bloomberg and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center are looking for Data Analysts with Python experience on their resume.</p><br>

                        <h2>4. Educator</h2>
                        <p>Someone has to teach Python, right? Becoming a computer science instructor may be the first thing that comes to mind, but it’s not the only teaching role available to those who know Python. Nearly every university and coding bootcamp, as well as online coding tutoring platforms.</p>
                        </div><br>

                        <h2>5. Financial Advisors</h2>
                        <center style="font-size: 13px;"><q>Forget Wall Street lingo. The language Citigroup Inc. wants its incoming investment bank analysts to know is Python</q> - Bloomberg, 2018</center>
                        <p>In 2018, Citigroup began training their bank analysts to learn Python. The hope is that having the chops to program computer code will cut costs, and increase the bank’s revenue.<br><br>

Business schools around the country have responded by teaching Python to their MBA students. According to Mattan Griffel, “Intro to Programming Using Python” is Columbia University Business School’s “most successful course launch in history.” Hundreds of finance students are eager to learn Python.</p><br>

                        <h2>6. Data Journalist</h2>
                        <p>Data journalism is a specialty within journalism that uses data to tell stories.
<br><br>
Journalist who know Python are in demand because of their ability to rapidly sort through information. If you’re a solid writer to boot, this might be just the role for you.
<br><br>
Amanda James, a data journalist at Law360, told One Month,</p>
                        <center style="font-size: 13px;"><blockquote>I use Python to arrange, analyze, and visualize data. There are so many different software libraries to work with in Python, such as matplotlib to create charts, pandas to sort and filter data and search for trends, and BeautifulSoup for web scraping, I feel that knowing Python has given me a versatile skill set.</blockquote></center>
